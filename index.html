	<H1>History</H1>

	<p>Bread has been a cornerstone of human civilization for over 14,000 years, with its earliest forms traced to unleavened flatbreads made by hunter-gatherers in the Fertile Crescent. As agriculture spread, so did breadmaking techniques—from ancient Egyptian conical loaves to the sourdough traditions of Europe. Among the many regional evolutions of bread, one of the most iconic emerged in Torino, Italy: grissini, or breadsticks. Invented in the late 17th century by baker Antonio Brunero to aid the digestion of young Duke Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy, these crisp, slender sticks were not only easy to digest but became a culinary sensation across Italy and beyond. Even Napoleon Bonaparte was so enamored with them that he arranged a stagecoach route from Torino to Paris just to receive his beloved “little sticks of Turin”. What sets Torino bread apart is its noble origin, artisanal precision, and timeless appeal—each stick a testament to the region’s blend of health-conscious innovation and gastronomic elegance. Whether served at royal banquets or modern tables, Torino bread remains a symbol of Italian excellence and enduring taste.</P>
