  <h1>History</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>The iconic food of Piedmont</p>
    <p>The noble origins of grissini – Italian for breadsticks – are linked to the Piedmont region of Italy and to the House of Savoy. This is just one of the many stories shared with guests on Meet Piemonte’s food tours in Turin or Alba.</p>
    <p>As one of the most representative elements of the cuisine of Piedmont, breadsticks lie on tables of restaurants and private homes next to the bread.</p>
    <p>Their popularity stands in being crunchy and tasteful, making them everyone’s favorite pairing for any meal, snacks or midnight whim.</p>

  <div class="origins">
    <h2>The Origins of Breadsticks in Piedmont</h2>
    <p>Grissini is the Italian word for the iconic crispy breadsticks which date back to around 1670.</p>
    <p>Their noble origins are tied to Duke Vittorio Amedeo II, whose doctor recommended digestible food to stimulate his appetite. Local baker Antonio Brunero created breadsticks in response.</p>
    <p>Legend has it that breadsticks gave the Duke strength to defeat the French siege of Turin and later become King of Sicily in 1713.</p>

  <div class="turin-impact">
    <h2>Grissini in the City of Turin</h2>
    <p>Locals believe breadsticks empowered the Duke’s rise. Baroque architecture was commissioned to elevate Turin’s status, and institutions like the University expanded.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="alternate-theories">
    <h2>Alternate Invention Theories</h2>
    <p>Some say Carlo Emanuele II requested hygienic bread in 1668, leading to Brunero’s invention. Others trace the name to “grissia,” a local term for small bread loaves.</p>
    <p>A travel diary from 1643 mentions “long and thin” bread in Chivasso, suggesting Brunero’s version was a refinement of an existing style.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="royal-fandom">
    <h2>Royal Enthusiasm</h2>
    <p>Members of the House of Savoy adored grissini. Carlo Felice and Carlo Emanuele III even carried special containers for them during travels.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="production">
    <h2>How Grissini Are Made</h2>
    <p>Traditional Robatà grissini are hand-rolled and made with flour and water. Stirati versions are flatter and crispier. Modern bakeries use olive oil and corn flour for added flavor and crunch.</p>
    <p>In Alba, food tours showcase the artisanal process: cutting, rolling, lining trays, and baking.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="cultural-impact">
    <h2>Grissini Across Europe</h2>
    <p>Napoleon loved them. Nietzsche wrote about them. French writers praised their digestibility and affordability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="culinary-use">
    <h2>How to Eat Breadsticks</h2>
    <p>In Piedmont, breadsticks reflect a restaurant’s quality. They’re served with ham, sauces, soups, or even chocolate. Chef Davide Scabin uses crumbled grissini for a signature beef cutlet dish.</p>
